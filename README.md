# Microsoft Graph Bicep Provider (public preview)

The "Microsoft Graph Bicep Provider" enables customers to manage a limited set of Identity/Graph resources (Entra ID, formerly known as Azure AD) in Bicep templates (alongside Azure resources) through native Microsoft Graph APIs.
This unblocks Infrastructure-as-Code/DevOps outcomes for Azure customers and will close a long-standing platform gap and pain-point.

Customers can then use [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/) to [deploy Bicep templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/deploy-cli) and their set of Azure and/or Identity resources.

The [releases page](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-bicep-types/releases) provides details on the supported Microsoft Graph Bicep types, limitations and known issues for the public preview.

To get going with the public preview, follow the instructions in [getting started](./docs/getting-started.md).
